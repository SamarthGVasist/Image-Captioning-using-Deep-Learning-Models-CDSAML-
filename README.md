# Image-Captioning-using-Deep-Learning-Models-CDSAML-
Built deep learning models for image captioning using InceptionV3, Resnet as CNN and LSTM, GRU as RNN decoders. Comparative study by varying the layers in the decoder and implementing an attention layer to get improved results. Used Flask framework to build the UI.
